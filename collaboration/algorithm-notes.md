# Algorithm & Calculation Optimization Strategy

## Current Performance Analysis

### Critical Performance Bottlenecks Identified

1. **O(n²) Flocking Algorithm** (Lines 616-638)
   - Every particle checks every other particle for neighbor interactions
   - For 1000 particles: 1,000,000 distance calculations per frame
   - **Impact**: CPU usage scales quadratically with particle count

2. **Inefficient Distance Calculations**
   - Using `distanceTo()` which includes expensive `Math.sqrt()` calls
   - Multiple distance checks per particle pair
   - No spatial optimization for proximity queries

3. **Excessive Per-Frame Calculations**
   - Trail updates for all particles every frame
   - Color transitions calculated for every particle
   - No LOD (Level of Detail) system for distant particles

4. **Memory Allocation Issues**
   - Frequent `Vector3.clone()` calls in hot paths
   - New object creation in animation loops
   - No object pooling for temporary calculations

## Optimization Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Spatial Partitioning (O(n²) → O(n log n))

#### Octree Implementation
```typescript
class SpatialOctree {
  bounds: THREE.Box3;
  particles: EnhancedParticle[];
  children: SpatialOctree[] | null;
  maxParticles: number;
  maxDepth: number;
  
  insert(particle: EnhancedParticle): void;
  query(bounds: THREE.Box3): EnhancedParticle[];
  clear(): void;
}
```

#### Spatial Hash Grid Alternative
- Divide 3D space into uniform grid cells
- Hash particle positions to grid coordinates
- Only check particles in adjacent cells (27 cells max)

### Phase 2: Distance Calculation Optimization

#### Squared Distance Optimization
```typescript
// Replace expensive Math.sqrt() calls
const distanceSquared = particle.position.distanceToSquared(other.position);
const radiusSquared = flockRadius * flockRadius;
if (distanceSquared < radiusSquared) {
  // Only calculate actual distance when needed
  const distance = Math.sqrt(distanceSquared);
}
```

#### Pre-computed Lookup Tables
- Cache common trigonometric values
- Pre-calculate interaction force tables
- Store normalized direction vectors

### Phase 3: LOD (Level of Detail) System

#### Distance-Based Quality Reduction
```typescript
const cameraDist = particle.position.distanceTo(camera.position);
const updateFrequency = cameraDist > 10 ? 3 : cameraDist > 5 ? 2 : 1;
if (frame % updateFrequency !== 0) return; // Skip update
```

#### Viewport Culling
- Only update particles visible in camera frustum
- Use Three.js frustum culling for spatial optimization
- Progressive quality degradation for off-screen particles

### Phase 4: Web Worker Integration

#### Physics Calculation Workers
```typescript
// Main thread: Render only
// Worker thread: Physics calculations
const physicsWorker = new Worker('./physics-worker.js');
physicsWorker.postMessage({
  particles: particleData,
  mousePosition,
  deltaTime
});
```

#### Double Buffering System
- Maintain two particle state buffers
- Worker updates one buffer while main thread renders other
- Swap buffers each frame for smooth updates

### Phase 5: Calculation Batching & Caching

#### Mouse Interaction Optimization
```typescript
// Cache mouse interaction calculations
const mouseInfluenceRadius = 4;
const mouseInfluenceRadiusSquared = mouseInfluenceRadius * mouseInfluenceRadius;

// Spatial query for mouse interactions only
const nearbyParticles = spatialGrid.query(mousePosition, mouseInfluenceRadius);
```

#### Force Calculation Batching
- Batch similar force calculations together
- Use SIMD operations where available
- Pre-calculate common force vectors
