### 4. **WebGL Context Management**
- **Issue**: Context loss events not properly handled in all scenarios
- **Impact**: Complete rendering failure until page reload
- **Recommendation**: Implement robust context restoration handling

## Optimization Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Implement Device-Aware Particle Scaling**
   ```typescript
   // Suggested implementation in ParticleSystem.tsx
   const adaptiveParticleCount = Math.min(
     targetParticleCount,
     deviceTier.recommendedParticles
   );
   ```

2. **Add Performance Monitoring to Production**
   ```typescript
   // Add to PerformanceMonitor.ts
   export const productionMonitor = {
     trackFPS: true,
     trackMemory: true,
     reportThreshold: { fps: 20, memory: 90 }
   };
   ```

3. **Implement Graceful Degradation**
   - Automatic quality reduction when FPS < 20fps

   - Add periodic garbage collection triggers
   - Optimize texture memory usage

3. **Interaction System Optimization**
