## Major Decisions

### 2025-08-21 - Design Iteration Strategy Framework

**Context:** Assembling specialized agent team for design iteration on Gallifrey Consulting dual-brand website. Four agents conducted comprehensive analysis and identified critical improvement areas.

**Decision:** Implement a coordinated three-phase approach to design system improvements

**Rationale:** 
- Multiple agents identified overlapping issues that require coordinated fixes
- Design system has solid foundation but needs consistency improvements
- Component architecture is strong but has optimization opportunities
- UX is excellent but specific technical issues need resolution

**Impact:** 
- Establishes clear roadmap for design iteration
- Prevents conflicting changes between agents
- Ensures accessibility and performance maintained during improvements
- Creates sustainable governance for ongoing design evolution

**Agents Involved:** Design System Specialist, Component Architecture, UX Specialist, Visual Design Critic, Code Review

### 2025-08-21 - Agent Coordination Protocol

**Context:** Need to establish clear communication and decision-making process for multi-agent design iteration

**Decision:** Implement structured agent coordination protocol with Review Agent as integration coordinator

**Rationale:**
- Prevents conflicting recommendations between specialized agents
- Ensures all changes consider cross-cutting concerns (accessibility, performance, maintainability)
- Provides clear escalation path for technical decisions
- Maintains code quality during rapid iteration

**Impact:**
- All design changes go through multi-agent review process
- Technical debt tracked and managed systematically
- Build and deployment stability maintained
- Design system governance automated where possible

**Agents Involved:** All agents

### 2025-08-21 - Priority Issue Resolution Order

**Context:** Multiple critical issues identified across agents with dependencies between fixes

**Decision:** 
1. **Phase 1 (Immediate):** Fix OYN hardcoded colors, contact form test error, font loading
2. **Phase 2 (Short-term):** Extract shared components, add performance optimizations
3. **Phase 3 (Medium-term):** Implement governance tools, component decomposition

**Rationale:**
- Phase 1 issues block design system consistency and testing
- Phase 2 builds foundation for maintainable iteration
- Phase 3 adds long-term sustainability tools
- Order minimizes risk of breaking changes

**Impact:**
- Clear implementation sequence prevents conflicts
- Early wins build momentum for larger changes
- Risk mitigation through staged approach
- Measurable progress at each phase

**Agents Involved:** All agents contributing to roadmap
