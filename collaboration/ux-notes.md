### 2025-08-21 16:40 - UX: "Own Your Narrative" Page Brand Consistency

**Analysis of `OwnYourNarrative.tsx`**

Following the review of the "Own Your Narrative" page, I've identified a brand consistency issue that needs to be addressed.

*   **Issue 1: Inconsistent Color Palette**
    *   **Location:** `components/OwnYourNarrative.tsx`
    *   **Description:** The "What Ownership Looks Like" section uses `green-50` and `green-600` colors, which are not part of the "Own Your Narrative" color palette (stone and orange). This creates a visual inconsistency.
    *   **Recommendation:** Replace the green colors with colors from the "Own Your Narrative" color palette. For example, use `oyn-orange-50` and `oyn-orange-600` to maintain brand consistency.
    *   **Priority:** Medium

**Next Actions:** I will wait for the Review Agent's approval before implementing this change.

### 2025-08-21 16:10 - UX: Minor Usability Improvements

**Analysis of Above-the-Fold Components**

Following the initial review, I've identified a couple of minor usability issues that could be improved.

*   **Issue 1: Header Layout Shift**
    *   **Location:** `components/Header.tsx`
    *   **Description:** The `Header` component changes height on scroll, which causes a slight layout shift. This can be visually jarring for some users.
    *   **Recommendation:** Modify the `Header` component to have a fixed height, regardless of the scroll position. The background color and shadow can still change on scroll.
    *   **Priority:** Low

*   **Issue 2: Mobile Menu Navigation**
    *   **Location:** `components/Header.tsx`
    *   **Description:** When the mobile menu is open, clicking a navigation link closes the menu, but the page does not scroll to the corresponding section.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement a smooth scroll effect when a mobile navigation link is clicked. This will improve the user experience on mobile devices.
-   **Priority:** Low

**Next Actions:** I will wait for the Review Agent's approval before implementing these changes.

5. **Loading States**: Form submission provides clear feedback

### Animation UX Score: 9.5/10

## üîç Specific UX Pain Points Identified

### Critical Issues to Address:

#### 1. Contact Form Regex Error
**Location:** `/tests/contact-form.spec.ts:169`

**Fix:** Replace `text=/consultation|book|schedule|calendar/i, [href*="calendar"], [href*="booking"]` with proper selector

#### 2. Campaign Page Loading Performance
**Location:** `/pages/own-your-narrative.tsx`
**Issue:** Heavy gradient backgrounds may impact Core Web Vitals
**Impact:** Potential bounce rate increase on slower devices
**Recommendation:** Consider CSS containment and will-change properties

#### 3. Form Validation Feedback
**Location:** `/components/ConsultativeContact.tsx`
**Issue:** Error states could be more prominent and accessible
**Impact:** Users may not notice validation issues
**Enhancement:** Add ARIA live regions for dynamic error announcements

## üéØ Brand Experience Consistency

### Dual-Brand Implementation Excellence
1. **Visual Differentiation**: Corporate blue vs. warm stone/orange clearly distinguishes audiences
