# Three.js Performance Optimization Guide

## Overview

This document details the comprehensive performance optimizations implemented for the Gallifrey Consulting hero section Three.js background. The optimizations enable smooth 60fps performance across all devices while supporting complex visual effects.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **PerformanceMonitor.ts** - Real-time FPS and device capability monitoring
2. **OptimizedParticleSystem.tsx** - GPU-accelerated particle rendering with shaders
3. **OptimizedConnectionLines.tsx** - Spatial partitioning for connection calculations
4. **ObjectPool.ts** - Memory management and garbage collection reduction
5. **ProgressiveLoader.ts** - Staged loading based on device capabilities
6. **OptimizedHeroScene.tsx** - Main scene orchestration with adaptive quality
7. **OptimizedThreeHeroBackground.tsx** - Canvas setup with performance optimizations

## Key Performance Features

### 1. Adaptive Quality System

**Device Detection:**
- Automatic GPU tier classification (low/medium/high/ultra)
- Memory estimation and capability assessment
- Mobile vs desktop detection
- WebGL2 support detection

**Dynamic Quality Adjustment:**
- Real-time FPS monitoring
- Automatic particle count scaling
- Connection line enable/disable
- Animation complexity adjustment
- Render scale optimization

```typescript
// Quality settings adapt based on performance
const quality = performanceMonitor.getCurrentQuality();
// Particles: 30-300 based on device
// Connections: enabled on medium+ devices
// Animation: low/medium/high complexity
```

### 2. GPU-Optimized Particle System

**Vertex Shader Animations:**
- All particle movement computed on GPU
- Noise-based organic motion
- Mouse interaction calculations
- LOD scaling based on distance

**Instanced Rendering:**

- Premultiplied alpha blending

**Features:**
- Particle count: 20-500 based on device tier
- Shader-based physics simulation
- Dynamic color interpolation
- Soft particle rendering with distance fade

### 3. Spatial Partitioning for Connections

**Hash Grid System:**
- O(1) nearest neighbor queries
- Configurable cell size (default: 3.0 units)
- Reduced computation from O(n²) to O(n×k)
- Maximum connection limits per device

**Connection Optimization:**
- Distance-based culling
- Strength calculation with mouse influence
- Animated wave effects in vertex shader
- Batch rendering with single geometry

### 4. Memory Management

**Object Pooling:**
- Pre-allocated Vector3, Matrix4, Color objects
- Particle data structure reuse
- Geometry and material pooling
- Automatic cleanup on component unmount

**Garbage Collection Reduction:**
- Minimal object creation in animation loops
- Buffer reuse for dynamic geometries
- Efficient attribute updates
- Memory leak prevention

### 5. Progressive Loading

**Staged Resource Loading:**
- Basic particles load first (tier: low, FPS: 20+)
- Enhanced particles on capable devices
- Connection lines for medium+ tier devices
- Advanced effects for high-end devices

**Adaptive Spawn Rates:**
- Ultra: 10 particles/frame
- High: 7 particles/frame  
- Medium: 5 particles/frame
- Low: 2 particles/frame

function HeroSection() {
  const [mousePosition, setMousePosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
  
  return (
    <section className="relative h-screen">
      <OptimizedThreeHeroBackground 
        variant="original"
        mousePosition={mousePosition}
      />
      {/* Your content here */}
    </section>
  );
}
```

### Performance Monitoring

```tsx
import { useThreePerformance } from './three/OptimizedHeroScene';

function PerformanceDisplay() {
  const performance = useThreePerformance();
  
  return (
    <div>
      FPS: {performance.fps}
      Particles: {performance.particleCount}
      GPU Tier: {performance.gpuTier}
    </div>
  );
}
