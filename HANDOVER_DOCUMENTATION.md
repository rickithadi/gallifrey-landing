# Handover Documentation - Three.js Hero Performance Optimization
## Multi-Agent Parallel Optimization Strategy

## Session Summary
**Date**: 2025-08-22
**Primary Focus**: Three.js hero section enhancement and performance optimization for Gallifrey Consulting website
**Current Status**: Three.js particle system implemented with advanced interactions, needs performance optimization
**Methodology**: USING MULTIPLE SUB-AGENTS FOR PARALLEL OPTIMIZATION

## Critical Instruction: USE MULTIPLE SUB-AGENTS
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: The user specifically requested using multiple sub-agents to delegate work in parallel. This is the preferred approach for completing the optimization tasks efficiently.

## Completed Work

### 1. Three.js Hero Background Implementation ‚úÖ
- Created sophisticated particle system with brand-accurate colors
- Implemented ThreeHeroBackground, HeroScene, ParticleSystem, and ConnectionLines components
- Added dynamic particle spawning from cursor movement
- Integrated with A/B testing system (lightweight vs original variants)

### 2. Advanced Mouse Interactions ‚úÖ
- **Four Interaction Modes Implemented**:
  - `attract`: Particles drawn to cursor (default)
  - `repel`: Particles pushed away from cursor
  - `vortex`: Circular swirling motion around cursor
  - `explosion`: Hold to charge, release for burst effect
- Click to cycle through modes
- Visual feedback via CursorGlow component with mode-specific colors

### 3. Brand Color Integration ‚úÖ
- **Gallifrey Brand Colors**:
  - Primary: `#2D5A87` (teal)
  - Secondary: `#1B365D` (charcoal)
- **OYN Campaign Colors**:
  - Accent: `#B8860B` (orange-600)
  - Accent2: `#CD853F` (orange-700)
- Colors properly integrated into particle system with smooth transitions

### 4. Performance Features Implemented ‚úÖ
- Particle pooling system for memory management
- Adaptive quality based on device capabilities (low/medium/high)
- GPU-optimized instanced mesh rendering
- Spatial hashing for efficient neighbor queries

## Current Issues Requiring Attention

### Performance Problems üî¥
1. **Slow Compilation**: Takes 100+ seconds to compile
2. **High Response Times**: 2-3 second load times for pages
3. **Frame Rate Issues**: Not consistently hitting 60fps
4. **Memory Usage**: Potential memory leaks in particle system

## Commands to Deploy Multi-Agent Team

```bash
# Step 1: Deploy all agents simultaneously using Task tool
# Each agent works on their specialized area in parallel

# Step 2: Monitor agent progress
# Check the collaboration files they create:
ls -la collaboration/

# Step 3: Run performance tests continuously
npm test -- --grep "performance"

# Step 4: Monitor dev server performance
# bash_2 is already running npm run dev
# Check compilation times and response times

# Step 5: Profile with Chrome DevTools
# Open localhost:3000 in Chrome
# Open Performance tab and record
```

## Testing URLs & Scenarios

## Critical Next Steps for Next Claude Instance

### 1. IMMEDIATELY Deploy Multi-Agent Team
```javascript
// Use Task tool to deploy all 5 agents in parallel
// Each agent has specific optimization responsibilities
// Agents should create test files and optimized components
// Monitor their progress through collaboration files
```

### 2. Continuous Performance Testing
```bash
# Run performance tests every 5 minutes
while true; do
  npm test -- --grep "performance"
  sleep 300
done
```

### 3. Iterate Based on Agent Findings
- Agents will identify specific bottlenecks
- Implement their recommended optimizations
- Test after each optimization
- Keep iterating until performance targets are met

## Important Notes
- **User Preference**: Use multiple sub-agents for parallel work
- **No Commits**: User prefers explicit commit requests
- **Test Everything**: Run tests continuously during optimization
- **Preserve Features**: Don't break existing functionality
- **Performance First**: Focus on speed over perfect code

## Success Validation
Once all agents complete their tasks:
1. Run full performance test suite
2. Verify all interaction modes still work
3. Check memory usage is stable
4. Confirm 60fps achievement
5. Validate bundle size < 200KB
6. Test on multiple devices/browsers

**CRITICAL REMINDER**: USE MULTIPLE SUB-AGENTS TO DELEGATE WORK IN PARALLEL
This is the user's explicit instruction and preferred working method.
